# Task 03: Text Generation with Markov Chains

A lightweight, statistical approach to text generation. This project uses N-order Markov Chains to build a probability graph of word transitions from a source corpus.

## 🧠 Concept
A Markov Chain follows the **Markov Property**: the probability of the next word depends only on the current state (the previous $n$ words), not on the entire history of the conversation.

## ⚙️ Features
- **Adjustable Order ($n$):** Higher orders produce more coherent text; lower orders produce more "random" but creative results.
- **Tokenization:** Handles basic punctuation as separate tokens to maintain sentence structure.
- **Lightweight:** No heavy libraries (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) required.
